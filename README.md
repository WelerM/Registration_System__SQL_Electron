# Description

A desktop application to collect visitor's information and save it in a local db file, which can be accessed in a friendly interface.
Perfect for small business/places where people's id has to be collected before their entering.

For convenience and consistance, i chose a javascript based database: https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb, which works with a local .db file that uses json like data, very similar to MongoDB, but there's no need for this application to be connected to some DBaaS. All you have to do is download and open the .exe file, no need for installation.

Technologies: JavaScript, Electron, Nedb, html and css.
