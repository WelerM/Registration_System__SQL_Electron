# Registration system for desktop created with Electron and SQL

# Description
A desktop application made with Electron framework and SQL. With this application you will be able to collect, save and search for visitors given information so a better control over people's flow in your place or business will be provided.

# How this project helps in the real life
This project came out of a necessity of my non IT job which is menaging the entrance of a building and taking standard information of every visitor coming in such as name, id, floor in which they are going to, etc... 
This project was then created to avoid writing all of that info by hand on a book.

# How to use it 
1 - In the project's root directory, type: npm install
2 - Replace the consts 'db_name', 'db_password', 'db_port' with your SQL's corresponding credentials.

# Hits and misses
This project was first intended to be created on a web browser by means of a Node API, which worked quite well but soon enough i realized that it wouldn't be practical since in order to start it, a terminal would have to be opened to start the server, and as this app would be used not only by me but by my coworkers as well, i had to find another way to make ir easier for common PC users. The first idea to come in mind was a turning the code into a .exe file and by that time i already knew about ElectronJS, so it was just a matter studying its documentation and adapting the code for this framework.
